## Description

Gemini Code Reviewer provides developers with an instant "second pair of eyes" on their code. By pasting a code snippet and selecting its programming language, users can receive a comprehensive review generated by Google's powerful Gemini model. The feedback is structured to be constructive and educational, covering multiple facets of software quality, from potential bugs to security vulnerabilities.

This tool aims to help developers improve their code quality, learn best practices, and catch issues early in the development cycle.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Code Analysis**: Leverages the `gemini-2.5-flash` model for fast and insightful code reviews.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports a wide range of popular programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Rust, Go, and more).
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: The review covers:
  - Correctness & Bugs
  - Best Practices & Readability
  - Performance Optimizations
  - Security Vulnerabilities
  - Maintainability & Scalability
- **Side-by-Side UI**: A clean, dual-panel interface for entering code and viewing the formatted feedback simultaneously.
- **Markdown Rendering**: The generated review is presented in well-formatted Markdown, including syntax highlighting for code suggestions.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Clear User States**: Includes loading and error indicators to provide a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

This project is designed to run in an environment where the API key can be securely managed as an environment variable (like Google's Project IDX or other cloud development environments).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    The application expects the Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. You will need to configure this in your hosting or development environment.

3.  **Run the application:**
    Since this is a client-side application with no build step, you can serve the files using a simple static server or open `index.html` directly in your browser after configuring the environment.

    For development, a tool like `live-server` is recommended:
    ```bash
    # Install live-server globally if you haven't already
    npm install -g live-server

    # Run from the project root
    live-server
    ```

## How It Works

1.  **User Input**: The user pastes their code into the text area on the left and selects the corresponding programming language from the dropdown menu.
2.  **Prompt Engineering**: When the "Review Code" button is clicked, the application constructs a detailed prompt for the Gemini API. This prompt instructs the AI to act as an expert senior software engineer and provides a structured template for the review.
3.  **API Call**: The prompt, along with the user's code, is sent to the `gemini-2.5-flash` model via the `@google/genai` SDK.
4.  **Response Handling**: The application awaits the response from the API.
5.  **Rendering Output**: The generated review, which is in Markdown format, is then parsed and rendered in the feedback panel on the right, providing a clear and readable analysis for the user.
